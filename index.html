        <h1>This is my first website!</h1>
        <h2>It's made purely in HTML</h2>
        <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and it isn't necessarily a programming language.</p>
        <p>
           HTML does not run logic like other langauges do, such as Python or C++. It just reads from a <b>.html</b> file and lays out the page according to those instructions! <br>
           It shares similarities to compiler languages such as C++, where in the .html file spacing doesn't matter when regarding the final result. <br>
           The instructions in the file are organized as such to enable readability for those editing, just like C++! <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            The file can be stored locally and accessed without internet, which is why when <b>right-clicking</b> on a web page you have the option to save the page! <br>
            This style of page layout and simplicity gives nostalgia of the internet back in the early 2000's; but can still be seen today when things go wrong when visiting a website. <br>
            Sometimes when going to <a href="https://www.csusb.edu" target="_blank">csusb.edu</a>, it may not load properly and you will be presented with a disordered front page that appears to be only HTML. <br>
            <u>NOTE:</u> Notice that the link is either blue or purple. Blue means you haven't visited the website before (according to your history), and purple means that you have visited the website before. <br>
            <u>NOTE:</u> Also notice if you clicked on the link, it opened in another tab in the browser instead of the current tab in which you clicked the link? That's because the target attribute was set to <b>_blank</b>
        </p>

        <h2>Now here's some other stuff for practice</h2>
        <h3>This here is an image of a shrimp</h3>
        <img src="shrimp.jpg" border = "3"> 
        <p>
            This is a <b>.jpg</b> of a cartoon shrimp taken from google. <br>
            It has a border that is <u>3 pixels wide</u>
        </p>
        <p>
            There are many things to discover about aquatic life, and that also applies to shrimp! <br>
            Here is a list of things to describe a shrimp, in no particular order:
            <ul>
                <li>In their natural state they are almost clear, or a transparent milky color</li>
                <li>They live underwater</li>
                <li>When cooked they turn a redish pink color</li>
                <li>They can be seasoned and cooked several ways
                    <ul>
                        Seasoning options:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
                            <li>Cajun</li>
                            <li>Garlic with spices</li>
                            <li>Soy sauce</li>
                        </ul>
                        Cooking methods:
                        <ul>
                            <li>BBQ</li>
                            <li>Boil</li>
                            <li>Steamed</li>
                            <li>Smoked</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is some fake data about shrimps organized in a table
        </p>
        <table border="2" cellpadding="10">
            <tr>
                <th>Region</th>
                <th colspan="2">Length of Adult</th>
                <th>Average age</th>
                <th>Typical color</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Pacific Ocean</td>
                <td>2 in.</td>
                <td>4 in.</td>
                <td>3 years</td>
                <td>Transparent</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Arctic Ocean</td>
                <td>1 in.</td>
                <td>3 in.</td>
                <td>4 years</td>
                <td>White</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Atlantic Ocean</td>
                <td>3 in.</td>
                <td>4 in.</td>
                <td>3 years</td>
                <td>Blue</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            HTML is a neat language that is the foundation of webpages and is ultimately what we see being displayed (to my current knowledge). <br>
            Other languages such as CSS and Java improve the versatility and functionality of web browsers and allow them to have a bigger impact on site visitors. <br>
            In conclusion, it was fun to go through this exercise and see what it's like using the barebones language for webpage displaying; before moving on to more advanced and versatile applications. <br>
        </p>
        This was made by Michael B, as a little introduction to web design; and to build an understanding to how webpages function.
